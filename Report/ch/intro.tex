\chapter{Intro}
The assignment was about making a shell, as known from various OS'es, where one could execute simple commands, pipe output/input, and run background processes among other things.

From the project description we derived the mandatory requirements [see Chapter 2.1], and used a simple iterative approach to comply with these.

We went with expanding the BOSC shell skeleton rather than writing a parser from scratch.

We used a simple GIT setup to be able to work simultaneously on the different additions in the codebase, aswell as this report which is written in LaTeX.
